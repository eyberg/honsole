####About
  I am usually in the habit of pasting multi-line blocks of code into a
console so I wanted the multi-line functionality -- however I don't
think using ctrl-d was what I wanted.

  There are quite a few other things that I want to do with this but
since all of heroku commands get piped through the HTTP API it's going
to take some thinking to get everything working the way I want it to
work -- btw -- don't blame me if you fuck up your production box as this
is in no way production quality code -- hell I can't even say it's worth
downloading at the moment since it's 100% untested.

  Remember kids -- You Use -- You Lose!

  heroku plugins:install git://github.com/feydr/honsole.git
